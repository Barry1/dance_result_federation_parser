[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/91bf9d49778b476ba30c5a8796767367)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Barry1/dance_result_federation_parser?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Barry1/dance_result_federation_parser&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)
I use [![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/Barry1/dance_result_federation_parser/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter) for code quality.

Further information to follow - but in short - just handover an event URL to `dance_result_federation_parser.py` or a single competition URL to `single_result_parser.py`.
You can configure your relevant federation in the variable `thefederation`.
