python tool to parse dance competition results for couples of given federation

I use [![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/Barry1/dance_result_federation_parser/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter) for code quality.

Further information to follow - but in short - just handover an event URL to `dance_result_federation_parser.py` or a single competition URL to `single_result_parser.py`.
You can configure your relevant federation in the variable `thefederation`.
